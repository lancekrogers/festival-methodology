# Contributing to Festival Methodology

Thank you for your interest in Festival Methodology! This is a living methodology that evolves through real-world usage and feedback.

## Philosophy

Festival Methodology is a **framework for organizing AI-assisted development**, not a rigid system. It's designed to be adapted to your specific workflow and needs. The core value comes from the three-level hierarchy (Phases → Sequences → Tasks) and interface-first planning principles.

## How to Contribute

### Share Your Experience

The most valuable contributions are **real-world usage reports**:

- What worked well for your project type?
- What modifications did you make for your workflow?
- What patterns emerged from using the methodology?
- What challenges did you encounter?

Open an issue to share your experience - these insights help evolve the methodology based on actual results.

### Suggesting Improvements

We're interested in:

- **Discovered patterns** that improved your workflow
- **Template enhancements** based on real usage
- **Documentation clarifications** where concepts were unclear
- **Case studies** showing successful festival implementations
- **AI agent refinements** that worked better in practice

### Using and Adapting

**Recommended approach:**

1. **Clone this repository** to use as your starting point
2. **Adapt the methodology** to your specific needs and workflow
3. **Use it in real projects** to see what works
4. **Share discoveries** that might benefit others

This is not a one-size-fits-all solution - it's a starting framework meant to be customized.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise language
- Include practical examples where possible
- Follow the existing markdown formatting style
- Keep the focus on practical application over theory

### Template Contributions

When contributing new templates:

- Ensure they follow the three-level hierarchy (Phases → Sequences → Tasks)
- Include clear placeholders and instructions
- Test the template with at least one real project
- Add an example in the `examples/` directory if appropriate

### AI Agent Contributions

For new AI agents:

- Follow the existing agent documentation format
- Clearly define the agent's role and capabilities
- Include example prompts and expected outputs
- Ensure agents complement existing methodology principles

## Philosophy

Festival Methodology values:

- **Practicality over perfection** - Real-world usage drives improvements
- **Flexibility over rigidity** - Adapt to different project needs
- **Clarity over complexity** - Keep it simple and understandable
- **Evolution over revolution** - Incremental improvements based on feedback

## Testing Your Adaptations

If you've discovered something valuable:

1. **Document the pattern** - What problem did it solve?
2. **Show the results** - How did it improve your workflow?
3. **Provide context** - What type of project benefited?
4. **Share via issue** - Open an issue describing your discovery

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue to discuss your experiences, challenges, or discoveries. The methodology grows through collective learning.
