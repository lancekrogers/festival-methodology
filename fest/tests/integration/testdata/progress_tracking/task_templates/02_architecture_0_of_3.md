# Task: Architecture Design


## Objective
Design the technical architecture for the todo app including data model, component structure, and technology stack decisions.

## Rules Compliance
Follow architectural best practices including separation of concerns, modularity, and scalability considerations.

## Context
Based on the requirements gathered in task 01, we need to design a clean architecture that supports the core todo list functionality while allowing for future extensibility. The architecture should be simple enough for an MVP while maintaining good engineering principles.

## Requirements
- Design data model for todo items
- Define component structure and responsibilities
- Select technology stack (language, framework, database)
- Plan state management approach
- Document API/interface contracts

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Design Data Model
Define the todo item structure including fields, data types, and relationships. Consider future extensibility while keeping MVP scope focused.

### 2. Component Architecture
Break down the system into logical components (UI, business logic, data access). Define clear interfaces and responsibilities for each component.

### 3. Technology Stack Selection
Evaluate and select appropriate technologies based on requirements, team expertise, and project constraints.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Data model designed with clear entity definitions
- [ ] Component architecture documented with interface contracts
- [ ] Technology stack selected and documented with rationale

## Testing
- Architecture reviewed for scalability and maintainability
- All components have clear responsibilities
- No circular dependencies
- Technology choices align with requirements

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] All requirements met
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Architecture diagrams created

## Notes
Good architecture decisions at this stage will make implementation smoother and reduce technical debt. Focus on simplicity and clear separation of concerns.
