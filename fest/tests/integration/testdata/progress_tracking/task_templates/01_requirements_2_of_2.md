# Task: Requirements Gathering

> **Task Number**: 01 | **Dependencies**: None | **Autonomy Level**: high

## Objective
Document comprehensive requirements for the todo app MVP including core functionality, user interface requirements, and technical constraints.

## Rules Compliance
Review project standards for requirements documentation and ensure all stakeholder needs are captured.

## Context
This is the foundation task for the todo app project. Clear requirements will guide the architecture design and implementation phases. We need to identify core features vs. nice-to-haves and establish acceptance criteria for each feature.

## Requirements
- Identify core todo list features (add, complete, delete, list)
- Define user interface requirements
- Document technical constraints and dependencies
- Establish success metrics
- Define MVP scope boundaries

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Interview Stakeholders
Review existing documentation and conduct stakeholder interviews to understand needs. Focus on identifying must-have vs. nice-to-have features.

### 2. Document Core Features
Create detailed descriptions of each core feature including user workflows, edge cases, and acceptance criteria.

### 3. Define Technical Constraints
Identify platform requirements, performance targets, data storage needs, and any integration requirements.

## Definition of Done
- [x] Core features identified and documented with acceptance criteria
- [x] Technical constraints and dependencies documented

## Testing
- Requirements reviewed by stakeholders
- All features have clear acceptance criteria
- No ambiguous or conflicting requirements

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] All requirements met
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Documentation clear and comprehensive

## Notes
This task establishes the foundation for the entire project. Taking time to gather thorough requirements will prevent rework later in the implementation phase.
