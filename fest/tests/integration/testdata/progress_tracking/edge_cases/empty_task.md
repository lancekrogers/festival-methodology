# Task: Empty Task File

> **Task Number**: 01 | **Dependencies**: None

## Objective
This task file intentionally has no checkboxes to test edge case handling.

## Context
This file tests how the progress tracking system handles tasks with no Definition of Done checkboxes.

## Notes
The system should default this to PENDING status and not break aggregation calculations.
