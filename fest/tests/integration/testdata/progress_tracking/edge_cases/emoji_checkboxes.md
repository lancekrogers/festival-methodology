# Task: Emoji Checkbox Format

> **Task Number**: 03 | **Dependencies**: None

## Objective
Test emoji-based checkbox notation support.

## Definition of Done
[✅] First requirement (complete - using checkmark emoji)
[🚧] Second requirement (in progress - using construction emoji)
[ ] Third requirement (pending - standard format)

## Notes
The markdown parser should recognize emoji-based checkbox formats:
- [✅] means completed
- [🚧] or [❌] means in progress or blocked
- [ ] means pending

With 1 complete and 1 in-progress out of 3 total, this should show IN_PROGRESS status.
