                    FEST CLI - GETTING STARTED GUIDE
================================================================================

Welcome to the Festival Methodology CLI! This guide will help you quickly
become productive with fest commands.

WHAT IS FESTIVAL METHODOLOGY?
─────────────────────────────
Festival Methodology is a goal-oriented project management system designed
for AI agent workflows. It organizes work into a 3-level hierarchy:

  Festival → Phase → Sequence → Task

  • Festival: The complete project (e.g., "Add Authentication System")
  • Phase:    Major milestone (e.g., "001_PLANNING", "002_IMPLEMENTATION")
  • Sequence: Related group of tasks (e.g., "01_database_schema")
  • Task:     Individual work item (e.g., "01_create_users_table.md")

Festivals live in a dedicated workspace directory (festivals/) that is
separate from your project repositories. This workspace contains:
  festivals/
  ├── .festival/    # Methodology resources and templates
  ├── active/       # Currently executing festivals
  ├── planned/      # Festivals being designed
  ├── completed/    # Finished festivals
  └── dungeon/      # Archived/deprioritized work

ESSENTIAL COMMANDS (LEARN THESE FIRST)
──────────────────────────────────────

  fest understand           Show methodology overview
  fest understand structure Learn the 3-level hierarchy in detail
  fest understand tasks     CRITICAL: When to create task files

  fest next                 Get the next task to work on
  fest validate             Check festival structure for issues

NAVIGATION
──────────

  fest go                   Navigate to festivals directory
  fest go active            Jump to active festivals
  fest go <festival>        Jump to a specific festival
  fest go <phase>           Jump to a phase directory
  fest list                 List all festivals with status

WORKFLOW COMMANDS
─────────────────

  fest next                 Get next task with agent instructions
  fest next --json          Machine-readable output for automation
  fest execute              Start execution mode for a festival
  fest progress --complete  Mark current task as complete
  fest progress --skip      Skip current task with reason

QUICK START WORKFLOW
────────────────────

  1. Navigate to an active festival:
     fest go active/<festival-name>

  2. Check festival structure:
     fest validate

  3. Get your first task:
     fest next

  4. Complete tasks and track progress:
     fest progress --complete

  5. Repeat steps 3-4 until festival complete

KEY PRINCIPLES
──────────────

  • STEPS NOT TIME: Think in terms of steps to reach a goal, not time estimates
  • READ BEFORE WRITING: Always understand existing structure first
  • GOAL FILES FIRST: Every level needs its goal document
  • IMPLEMENTATION = TASKS: Implementation phases MUST have task files
  • FLEXIBLE PHASES: Planning/Review/Research phases may be structured or freeform
  • VALIDATE OFTEN: Run fest validate before and after changes
  • SEQUENTIAL WORK: Complete tasks in order within sequences

  fest understand methodology

For all available commands:
