Festival Structure - Three-Level Hierarchy
==========================================

Festival Methodology uses a three-level hierarchy:

  FESTIVAL (the project)
    └── PHASE (major stage of work)
          └── SEQUENCE (group of related tasks)
                └── TASK (atomic unit of work)

Naming Conventions (MANDATORY)
------------------------------

  Phases:     NNN_PHASE_NAME      3-digit, UPPERCASE
  Sequences:  NN_sequence_name    2-digit, lowercase
  Tasks:      NN_task_name.md     2-digit, lowercase, .md extension

Parallel Execution
------------------

Tasks with the same number execute in parallel:

  01_frontend_setup.md  ┐
  01_backend_setup.md   ├── Run simultaneously
  01_database_setup.md  ┘
  02_integration.md     ← Waits for all 01_ tasks

For detailed requirements: fest understand rules
For template variables:    fest understand templates
