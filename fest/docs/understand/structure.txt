Festival Structure - Three-Level Hierarchy
==========================================

Festival Methodology uses a three-level hierarchy:

  FESTIVAL (the project)
    └── PHASE (major stage of work)
          └── SEQUENCE (group of related tasks)
                └── TASK (atomic unit of work)

Naming Conventions (MANDATORY)
------------------------------

  Phases:     NNN_PHASE_NAME      3-digit, UPPERCASE
  Sequences:  NN_sequence_name    2-digit, lowercase
  Tasks:      NN_task_name.md     2-digit, lowercase, .md extension

Required Files at Each Level
----------------------------

  Festival:   FESTIVAL_OVERVIEW.md, FESTIVAL_RULES.md
  Phase:      PHASE_GOAL.md
  Sequence:   SEQUENCE_GOAL.md
  Task:       Individual .md files with task instructions

Optional but Recommended
------------------------

  Festival:   CONTEXT.md (decisions/rationale), STATUS_UPDATE.md, TODO.md
  Phase:      IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md (for implementation phases)
  Sequence:   results/ directory (for output artifacts)

Parallel Execution
------------------

Tasks with the same number execute in parallel:

  01_frontend_setup.md  ┐
  01_backend_setup.md   ├── Run simultaneously
  01_database_setup.md  ┘
  02_integration.md     ← Waits for all 01_ tasks

Quality Gates (REQUIRED for Implementation Sequences)
-----------------------------------------------------

Every implementation sequence MUST end with these three tasks:

  XX_testing_and_verify.md      Verify functionality works
  XX_code_review.md             Review code quality
  XX_review_results_iterate.md  Address findings

Example: If your last implementation task is 03_*, quality gates are 04_, 05_, 06_
