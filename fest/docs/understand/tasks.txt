Task Files - Critical for AI Execution
======================================

THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION
------------------------

Goal documents define WHAT to achieve.
Task files define HOW to execute.

  SEQUENCE_GOAL.md  → Defines the objective
  01_design.md      → Task: specific work to perform
  02_implement.md   → Task: specific work to perform

AI agents EXECUTE TASK FILES, not goals.

Without task files, agents know the objective but don't know
what specific work to perform.


WHEN TO CREATE TASK FILES
-------------------------

ALWAYS create task files for implementation sequences.

  Implementation sequences (NEED task files):
    • *_api, *_backend, *_frontend, *_infrastructure
    • *_feature*, *_implementation*, *_development
    • Any sequence where code/deliverables are produced

  Planning sequences (goals often sufficient):
    • *_planning, *_research, *_requirements, *_design
    • *_discovery, *_analysis, *_architecture
    • However: even planning may benefit from tasks


CORRECT STRUCTURE
-----------------

  02_api_endpoints/
  ├── SEQUENCE_GOAL.md          ← Defines objective
  ├── 01_design_endpoints.md    ← Task: design work
  ├── 02_implement_crud.md      ← Task: implementation
  ├── 03_add_validation.md      ← Task: more implementation
  ├── 04_testing_and_verify.md  ← Quality gate
  ├── 05_code_review.md         ← Quality gate
  └── 06_review_results_iterate.md ← Quality gate


INCORRECT STRUCTURE (Common Mistake)
------------------------------------

  02_api_endpoints/
  └── SEQUENCE_GOAL.md          ← WRONG: No task files!

  This tells agents WHAT to do but not HOW to execute.
  Agents need task files to work autonomously.


TASK FILE CONTENTS
------------------

Each task file should contain:

  # Task: [Name]

  ## Objective
  Clear statement of what this task accomplishes

  ## Requirements
  - Specific requirement 1
  - Specific requirement 2

  ## Implementation Steps
  1. First concrete step
  2. Second concrete step

  ## Definition of Done
  - [ ] Deliverable 1 complete
  - [ ] Tests pass
  - [ ] Documentation updated


PARALLEL EXECUTION
------------------

Tasks with the SAME number run in parallel:

  01_frontend_setup.md  ┐
  01_backend_setup.md   ├── Run simultaneously
  01_database_setup.md  ┘
  02_integration.md     ← Waits for all 01_ tasks

Use this for independent work streams within a sequence.


CREATING TASK FILES
-------------------

Use the CLI to create task files efficiently:

  fest create task --name "design endpoints" --json
  fest create task --name "implement crud" --json
  fest create task --name "add validation" --json

Then add quality gates automatically:

  fest task defaults sync --approve --json


VALIDATE YOUR STRUCTURE
-----------------------

Run validation to check task files exist:

  fest validate tasks --json

This checks that implementation sequences have task files,
not just goal documents.

Full validation:

  fest validate --json

Post-completion checklist:

  fest validate checklist --json


COMMON MISTAKES
---------------

1. Creating only goal files
   WRONG: Only SEQUENCE_GOAL.md in implementation sequences
   FIX: Add task files (01_design.md, 02_implement.md, etc.)

2. Tasks too vague
   WRONG: "02_implement_feature.md" with no details
   FIX: Specific steps, requirements, and definition of done

3. Missing quality gates
   WRONG: Implementation tasks without testing/review
   FIX: Run 'fest task defaults sync --approve --json'

4. Not filling templates
   WRONG: Task files with [FILL:] markers still present
   FIX: Replace all template markers with actual content


REMEMBER
--------

  Goals define WHAT to achieve.
  Tasks define HOW to execute.
  AI agents execute TASK FILES.

If your sequences only have goals, agents won't know what to do.
