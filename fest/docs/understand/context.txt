CONTEXT.md - Festival Memory Document
=====================================

PURPOSE: Maintain continuity across AI sessions and human reviews.

CONTEXT.md is the "memory" of your festival - capturing decisions, blockers,
questions, and handoff notes that persist between sessions.

WHEN TO CREATE
--------------
CREATE CONTEXT.md FIRST, before detailed planning. It should capture:
- Why this festival exists (problem being solved)
- Key constraints and requirements
- Initial assumptions being made
- Who needs to answer questions

This prevents agents from losing focus on the festival's purpose.

WHAT IT CAPTURES
----------------
1. KEY DECISIONS MADE
   - Architecture decisions with rationale
   - Implementation choices and why
   - Technology selections and tradeoffs

2. DEFERRED ITEMS
   - Features postponed with reasoning
   - Revisit criteria (when to reconsider)

3. ACTIVE ASSUMPTIONS
   - Technical assumptions (APIs, dependencies)
   - Business assumptions (requirements, scope)
   - Resource assumptions (time, capabilities)

4. OPEN QUESTIONS
   - High priority (blocking) - need immediate answers
   - Medium priority (important) - need before completion
   - Low priority - can defer

5. SESSION HANDOFF NOTES
   - Work completed this session
   - Work in progress
   - Blockers encountered
   - Recommended next steps

6. RISK REGISTER
   - New risks identified
   - Status changes on existing risks

WHEN TO UPDATE
--------------
- At END of each work session
- When significant decisions are made
- When blockers are encountered
- When questions arise that need human input
- When scope or requirements change

USING CONTEXT
-------------
The `fest context` command reads CONTEXT.md and provides relevant context:

  fest context              # Get context for current location
  fest context --json       # Output as JSON for agents
  fest context --verbose    # Explanatory output

This injects your decisions and notes into agent context automatically.

TEMPLATE
--------
Create CONTEXT.md from template:

  fest create festival --name "my-festival"  # Includes CONTEXT.md

Or manually copy from:
  festivals/.festival/templates/CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR AI AGENTS
------------------------------
Without CONTEXT.md:
- Each session starts with no memory of prior work
- Decisions get re-debated or contradicted
- Blockers aren't documented for human review
- Focus drifts from original festival purpose

With CONTEXT.md:
- Sessions resume with full decision history
- Agents maintain consistent direction
- Humans can asynchronously answer questions
- Festival purpose stays front and center

TIP: Create CONTEXT.md FIRST and fill in the "Why this festival exists"
section before doing any other planning. This keeps agents focused.
