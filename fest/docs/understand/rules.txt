Festival Structure Rules (MANDATORY)
====================================

The fest CLI enforces a RIGID structure that enables automation.
These rules are NOT suggestions - they are requirements.

NAMING CONVENTIONS
------------------

  Level      Format              Example
  ─────      ──────              ───────
  Phase      NNN_PHASE_NAME      001_PLAN, 002_IMPLEMENT, 003_REVIEW
  Sequence   NN_sequence_name    01_requirements, 02_api, 03_frontend
  Task       NN_task_name.md     01_design.md, 02_build.md, 03_test.md

  • Phases:    3-digit prefix, UPPERCASE name
  • Sequences: 2-digit prefix, lowercase name
  • Tasks:     2-digit prefix, lowercase name, .md extension

REQUIRED FILES
--------------

  Festival Root:
    FESTIVAL_OVERVIEW.md    [REQUIRED] Project goal, scope, stakeholders
    FESTIVAL_RULES.md       [REQUIRED] Quality standards and team rules
    TODO.md                 [Recommended] Progress tracking
    fest.yaml               [Optional] Quality gate configuration

  Each Phase (NNN_NAME/):
    PHASE_GOAL.md           [REQUIRED] Phase objectives and evaluation

  Each Sequence (NN_name/):
    SEQUENCE_GOAL.md        [REQUIRED] Sequence objectives and dependencies

QUALITY GATES
-------------

Every IMPLEMENTATION sequence MUST end with these 3 tasks:

    [your tasks here...]
    XX_testing_and_verify.md       ← Validates all deliverables
    XX+1_code_review.md            ← Reviews implementation quality
    XX+2_review_results_iterate.md ← Addresses review findings

  Use 'fest gates apply --approve' to add quality gates automatically.

  Excluded sequences (no quality gates needed):
    - *_planning, *_research, *_requirements, *_docs

PARALLEL EXECUTION
------------------

Tasks with the SAME number execute in parallel:

    01_backend.md   ┐
    01_database.md  ├── Run simultaneously
    01_frontend.md  ┘
    02_integrate.md ← Waits for all 01_ tasks to complete

Use this for independent work streams within a sequence.

WHY THIS MATTERS
----------------

This rigid structure enables:
  • Automated quality gate insertion via 'fest gates apply'
  • Consistent navigation across all festivals
  • Parallel task detection and scheduling
  • Progress tracking and reporting
  • Template variable auto-computation (parent_phase_id, full_path, etc.)

Run 'fest understand templates' to learn how to pass variables.
