Festival Methodology - Core Principles
======================================

1. Goal-Oriented Development
----------------------------

Everything is organized around achieving a specific goal. A "festival"
represents the complete journey from problem to solution.

2. Requirements-Driven Implementation
-------------------------------------

CRITICAL: Implementation sequences can ONLY be created AFTER requirements
are defined. Never guess what to implement.

  Human provides:
  • Project goals and vision
  • Requirements and specifications
  • Architectural decisions
  • Feedback and iteration guidance

  AI agent creates:
  • Structured sequences from requirements
  • Detailed task specifications
  • Implementation code
  • Progress tracking and documentation

3. Phase Adaptability
---------------------

Phases are guidelines, not rigid requirements. Adapt to your needs.

4. Quality Gates
----------------

Every implementation sequence ends with testing, review, and iteration tasks.
Use 'fest task defaults sync' to add these automatically.

5. Step-Based Progress
----------------------

Think in steps, not time. Track progress by completed tasks, not hours.
