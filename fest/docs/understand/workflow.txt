Festival Workflow - Just-in-Time Reading
========================================

The just-in-time approach preserves context window for actual work.

When to Read What
-----------------

  Resource              Read When
  ────────────────────  ─────────────────────────────────────
  fest understand       Now - provides methodology overview
  Templates             ONLY when creating that document type
  Examples              ONLY when stuck or need clarification
  Agents                ONLY when using that specific agent

NEVER Do This
-------------

  ✗ Reading all templates upfront "to understand them"
  ✗ Loading all agent files at once
  ✗ Reading examples before trying yourself

ALWAYS Do This
--------------

  ✓ Read templates one at a time as you create documents
  ✓ Read examples only when stuck
  ✓ Close files after extracting what you need
  ✓ Focus context on actual work, not documentation

Execution Pattern
-----------------

PLANNING a new festival:
0. Create CONTEXT.md FIRST - capture why this festival exists
   This prevents losing focus on the festival's purpose.
   See: fest understand context

EXECUTING an existing festival:
1. Read FESTIVAL_GOAL.md to understand the objective
2. Read CONTEXT.md for decisions and current state
3. Check TODO.md for current status
4. Navigate to the current phase/sequence
5. Read ONLY the current task file
6. Execute the task
7. Update CONTEXT.md with decisions/blockers
8. Mark complete and move to next

Using fest CLI Efficiently
--------------------------

The CLI is self-documenting. Use --help instead of reading docs:

  fest --help                    # All commands
  fest create --help             # Create subcommands
  fest create festival --help    # Specific command details
  fest gates --help              # Quality gate management

JSON output provides structured responses:

  fest create phase --name "IMPLEMENT" --json
