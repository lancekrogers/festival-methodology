Festival Methodology - AI Agent Build System
=============================================

Festival Methodology is a goal-oriented project management system designed
for human-AI collaboration and long-running autonomous development cycles.

Core Concepts
-------------

• Three-level hierarchy: Phases → Sequences → Tasks
• Requirements-driven: Implementation only after requirements are defined
• Just-in-time context: Read templates and docs only when needed
• Quality gates: Every sequence ends with testing, review, iteration


Quick Start
-----------

  fest understand --help        # See all topics
  fest understand rules         # MANDATORY structure requirements
  fest understand templates     # Variables that save tokens
  fest understand structure     # Scaffold examples with annotations

Token-Efficient Workflow
------------------------

Use the fest CLI instead of manual file creation:

  fest create festival --name "my-project" --goal "Build X" --json
  fest create phase --name "IMPLEMENT" --json
  fest create sequence --name "api" --json
  fest task defaults sync --approve --json   # Add quality gates

Variables are passed to templates - no post-creation editing needed.
Run 'fest understand templates' to see all available variables.
