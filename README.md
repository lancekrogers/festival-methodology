# Festival Methodology

[![Methodology: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Methodology-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)
[![CLI: Source Available](https://img.shields.io/badge/CLI-Source%20Available-blue.svg)](fest/LICENSE)
[![Development Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-pre--release-orange)](CHANGELOG.md)

A goal-based methodology that helps you **collaboratively create actionable tasks** for AI agents to execute in long-running autonomous sessions. Festival transforms high-level objectives into structured, executable work that AI can complete independently.

## What Festival Does

Festival bridges the gap between what you want to build and what AI agents can actually execute:

```mermaid
graph LR
    G[Your Goal] --> P[Plan Together]
    P --> T[Create Tasks]
    T --> E[AI Executes]
    E --> D[Delivered System]
```

## Core Benefits

Festival enables:

- **Long-running autonomous builds** - AI agents work for hours or days, not minutes
- **Goal-driven development** - Hierarchical goals with built-in evaluation frameworks
- **Executable specifications** - Every task includes concrete steps AI can follow
- **Context preservation** - Decisions and rationale maintained across sessions
- **Autonomy awareness** - Tasks marked for independent vs collaborative work
- **Parallel execution** - Multiple agents work simultaneously on different parts

## What Makes Festival Different

### 🎯 Hierarchical Goal System

Every level of your project has clear, measurable goals:

- **Festival Goals** - Overall success criteria and KPIs
- **Phase Goals** - Stage-specific objectives that build toward the festival goal
- **Sequence Goals** - Granular targets that ensure phase completion

Each goal includes evaluation frameworks, so you always know if you've succeeded.

### 🧠 Context Preservation

The `CONTEXT.md` file captures:

- Key decisions and rationale
- Session handoff notes
- Open questions for human review
- Lessons learned during execution

This maintains continuity across AI sessions and human reviews.

### 🤖 Autonomy Levels

Every task is marked with an autonomy level:

- **High** - Agent completes independently
- **Medium** - May need edge case clarification
- **Low** - Expect human collaboration

This helps agents know when to proceed vs when to ask for help.

### 📚 Just-In-Time Documentation

Agents read templates and examples only when needed, preserving context window for actual work.

## How It Works: From Goal to Execution

### 1. Define Your Goal

You specify what you want to achieve - a complete feature, system, or product.

### 2. Create Goal Hierarchy

Festival helps structure your goal into measurable objectives at every level.

### 3. Plan with Autonomy Levels

Break down work into tasks, marking which can be done autonomously.

### 4. Execute with Context Tracking

AI agents work independently, documenting decisions in CONTEXT.md.

### 5. Evaluate Against Goals

Review progress using built-in evaluation frameworks.

### 6. Iterate or Complete

Based on goal achievement, refine and continue or mark complete.

```

## Creating Actionable Tasks

Festival tasks aren't vague descriptions - they're complete specifications AI can execute:

```markdown
# Task: 01_implement_user_authentication.md

**Autonomy Level:** high # Agent can complete independently

## Objective

Create JWT-based authentication with email/password login

## Requirements

- [ ] User registration endpoint
- [ ] Login with email/password
- [ ] JWT token generation (15min access, 7day refresh)
- [ ] Password hashing with bcrypt
- [ ] Rate limiting (5 attempts/minute)

## Implementation Steps

1. Install dependencies:
   npm install jsonwebtoken bcrypt express-rate-limit

2. Create database schema:
   - users table (id, email, password_hash, created_at)
   - refresh_tokens table (token, user_id, expires_at)

3. Implement endpoints:
   - POST /api/auth/register
   - POST /api/auth/login
   - POST /api/auth/refresh
   - POST /api/auth/logout

## Validation

- Test registration with: curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/auth/register ...
- Verify JWT expiration times
- Check rate limiting blocks after 5 attempts
- Ensure passwords are hashed, not plain text

## Deliverables

- [ ] src/routes/auth.js - Authentication endpoints
- [ ] src/middleware/auth.js - JWT verification
- [ ] src/models/User.js - User model with password hashing
- [ ] tests/auth.test.js - Complete test coverage
```

This level of detail, combined with autonomy levels, enables AI agents to work independently while knowing when to seek help.

## Real-World Usage

Festival Methodology is **actively used and refined through daily development**. It's a living system that evolves based on practical experience:

- Extends autonomous AI coding sessions from hours to multiple days
- Reduces context switching between human and AI work
- Enables complex feature development with minimal supervision
- Particularly effective with tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf

### Realistic Expectations

- **Festival gets you 90% there autonomously** - AI agents handle the bulk of implementation
- **Human expertise guides the final 10%** - Your insight ensures quality and correctness
- **Goals evolve as you learn** - Multiple festivals may be needed as requirements clarify
- **Best for complex, multi-day projects** - Not needed for simple, single-task work

## Getting Started

### 1. Verify and Install Festival Structure

```bash
# Clone or copy the festival structure
cp -r festivals/ /your/workspace/
cd /your/workspace/festivals/

# CRITICAL: Agents must verify methodology exists
ls -la .festival/

# Read the agent instructions
cat README.md
```

### 2. Define Your Goal Hierarchy

Create goal documents at each level:

- `FESTIVAL_GOAL.md` - Overall project success criteria
- `PHASE_GOAL.md` - Goals for each phase
- `SEQUENCE_GOAL.md` - Goals for each sequence

### 3. Use Planning Agent

The Festival planning agent helps structure your project:

```bash
# Point AI agent to the planning agent
# It will guide you through structured planning
festivals/.festival/agents/festival_planning_agent.md
```

### 4. Mark Autonomy Levels

As you create tasks, assign autonomy levels:

- Review similar past tasks to gauge complexity
- Start conservative (low autonomy) for unfamiliar work
- Increase autonomy as patterns emerge

### 5. Launch Autonomous Execution

AI agents read tasks and work independently, updating CONTEXT.md with decisions and progress.

### 6. Review and Iterate

Use goal evaluation frameworks to assess progress and determine next steps.
